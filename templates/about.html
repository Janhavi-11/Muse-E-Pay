  <h2>About MUS-E-TICK</h2>
  <div class="content">
    Our Website MUS-E-TICK aims at making the experience of visitors visiting museums and heritage sites easier and more convenient. Paperless tickets will facilitate the visitors to pre-book their visits.
    This is the web-based project with its main aim to simplify the user’s dependability on the ticket sellers to buy the tickets and reduce the fraud of transactions through modern and secured payment gateways allowing the users to complete their payments.
    <br>
    The smartphone, which has a profound effect on people’s daily routine can be used for paperless ticketing. User can access the system through website at any time through mobile or laptop or any other smart device instead of going to the campus to buy the tickets.
    This application would also allow the user to buy tickets individually as well as for the group.
    <br>
    The process of entering a museum becomes quick and easy with a scannable quick response ticket. Lines move faster more visitors are able to enter in a shorter amount of time.
    <br>
    Data gathered from ticket sales enables understanding of type of visitors and purchase patterns. Monuments owners can then create packages, offers, even exhibits with greater appeal.
    <br>
    Using the Customer demographics like age and location will help us understand what visitors are interested in any particular monument, and allow you to plan future exhibits and events accordingly.
    Admin can conveniently validate the ticket issued by the app and maintain record of the revenue and visitors.
    <br>
    With this app we enable the Prediction of incoming crowd on any particular day and suggest the visitors with optimal time slots according to the current crowd present at the moment.
    <br>
    This proposal will also help crack down on those who visit in such a bogus manner. By implementing this new web-roach, E-ticketing system will be able to implement Smart Ticketing systems and effective authentication techniques.
