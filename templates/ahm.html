  <h3>ABOUT</h3>
  <p>
    Nestled within the green campus of St. Pius X College in Goregaon East, the Archdiocesan Heritage Museum is one of only two such Christian museums in India. Since its establishment in 2011 in what was once a seminary gymnasium, the museum has become a repository of rare and antique Christian artefacts sourced from churches across Mumbai, Pune, and Goa. Painstakingly curated, these artefacts include sculptures, manuscripts, metalwork, and religious embroidery—many rescued from church attics, crypts, and altars.
  </p>
  <p>
    The museum tells the story of Christianity’s journey in the region through beautifully restored objects dating back to the 16th century—the era of Portuguese evangelisation. Highlights include a gold-foiled early edition of the King James Bible and a cross-cultural statue of St. Paul from Malad, featuring Hindu iconography like a lotus base and ascetic beard. Another key attraction is the artwork of Angelo da Fonseca, an Indian Christian artist known for depicting Christian themes through Indian cultural lenses.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a mission to preserve and present Christian heritage in India, the museum offers a contemplative and educational experience. Aesthetic displays, well-lit interiors, and a thoughtful layout make it a must-visit for anyone interested in history, culture, or religious art. The Archdiocesan Heritage Museum not only safeguards objects of faith but also revives the forgotten narratives surrounding them—making it a meaningful stop in Mumbai’s cultural itinerary.
