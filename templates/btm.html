      <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      <p>
        The Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Mumbai City Museum is an institution of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. It is India’s first cultural public-private partnership, established in 2003 between the MCGM, Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation, and INTACH.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally established in 1872 as the Victoria and Albert Museum, it is Mumbai’s oldest museum, showcasing the city's cultural legacy through rare collections of Fine and Decorative Arts, including clay models, dioramas, maps, lithographs, photographs, and books.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a major five-year restoration, the museum reopened in 2008 and won the UNESCO 2005 Award of Excellence for Cultural Conservation. It actively promotes contemporary art and culture alongside historic exhibits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The museum also hosts international exhibitions, and since 2012, its Museum Plaza has served as a cultural space for performances and workshops. Redeveloped spaces now include a Museum Café, Shop, Education Centre, and Special Projects Space.
      </p>
      <p>
        A major expansion is underway, including a new wing with a Mumbai Modern Gallery, special exhibition spaces, conservation centre, auditorium, library, and improved visitor amenities.
